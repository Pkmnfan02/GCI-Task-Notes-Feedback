Feed Back Questions

Q.Were you able to set up the server?
A. Yup, I could set up a server.
Q.Did you get any errors. (What were they?)
A. Yes, the game laucher provided crashed and froze. However I could not replicate the error and I was unable to get screenshots.
Q.What was the hardest part of setting up the server?
A. It was actually really simple for me. The friend I gave the address code to was on the same wifi, but if you were connecting to someone in a different country that could pose a problem, its just something to think about.
Q.How do you think we could make it easier?
A. You could make it easier by have the address code given to you instead of having to look through the code on the terimal.
